# Proposal
For the next four weeks I am going to write my own artificial intelligence which can read handwritten numbers and determine which number is written down. While making this AI I will learn a lot about machine learning and how common AI like ChatGPT work.

## Requirements
- The AI should provide the percentages of how likely the handwritten number look like numbers 0 trough 9
- The AI should provide the correct number for each given handwritten number
- The AI should be written from scratch in Python
- The AI should not make use of any packages, libraries or databases except the MNIST database

## Learning goals
- Learn how machine learning and artificial intelligence works
- Learn how to create my own artificial intelligence
- Learn to be able 

## MNIST database
The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten numbers that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.
